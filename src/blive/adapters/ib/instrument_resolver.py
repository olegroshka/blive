"""IB instrument resolver — :class:`Instrument` ↔ ``ib_async.Contract`` / ``conId``.

Implements [DD-7 §5](../../../../docs/dd/instrument_dictionary.md#5-public-surface-m2-module)
public surface per [ADR-032](../../../../docs/decisions/DECISIONS.md#adr-032--instrument-resolution-policy-blive-instrument--ib-contract).
The IB analogue of :class:`blive.adapters.ig.instrument_resolver.IGInstrumentResolver`.

Resolution flow (DD-7 §4):

1. Build an ``ib_async.Contract`` from the broker-neutral
   :class:`blive.domain.types.Instrument` via :meth:`to_contract` (sync,
   no wire call) per the DD-7 §1 field map + §2 secType + §3 exchange
   tables.
2. On first :meth:`resolve` call for a given instrument, invoke
   ``ib.qualifyContractsAsync(contract)``; the call consumes one
   ``global`` token from the rate limiter.
3. Cache the resulting ``conId`` keyed by full :class:`Instrument` tuple
   equality. Subsequent calls return the cached id without a wire trip.
4. Multiple candidates after qualification raise :class:`InstrumentAmbiguous`;
   zero candidates / ``conId == 0`` raise :class:`InstrumentNotResolvable`.
   The resolver **never silently picks** when the venue is ambiguous —
   the caller must construct a more specific :class:`Instrument`.

Cache lifetime: process. Corp-action invalidation via :meth:`clear_cache`
(M5 reconciliation hook). All wire calls go through :class:`IBClient`'s
:class:`TokenBucketRateLimiter` budget.
